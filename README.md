## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I tried to find some classes without looking at the GIFs provided in the CodePath pre-work instructions and had trouble to find them without having a visual example. After a while I preferred to just check at the visual references and be patient with the learning process.
